# Online Jewelry Shop System in Django with Source Code

The **Online Jewelry Shop System Project in Django** created based on **Python**, **Django**, and **SQLITE3 Database**. 

The **Online Jewelry Shop System** project that will assist a Jewelry store or store in providing an online ordering system for their customers.

The system has two user interfaces: one for the admin user, or Jewelry management, and the other for the client, or the system‚Äôs website. Customers must register on the website before they can conduct business with the Jewelry shop.

An **Online Jewelry Shop System** is simple to navigate, and the features are similar to those found in other online stores.

The Jewelry items are grouped by item categories to make it easier for consumers to find what they‚Äôre looking for.

Each product can have a different color, size, sample image, and thorough description thanks to the system. Since some of the jewelry products do not need this area, the sizes and colors fields are not needed.

> To start creating an **Online Jewelry Shop System Project in Python Django**, makes sure that you have PyCharm Professional IDE Installed in your computer.
